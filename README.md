# CardGames
Implemented Blackjack in C#. This is an initial attempt using concepts I know. 

========================================================
Initial Push 2/6/2019 12:18AM EST:
Console application Blackjack. At this time, only hit and stay are implemented for the Player moves. There are a number of bugs that I found with the initial version that I coded, but it runs more or less as expected for a first version. There are potentially a few more bugs that I'll discover as I run it some more. 

I'm aware that I probably should've used an abstract class that Player and Dealer should've inherited from. Once I make sure that there aren't any bugs left, I will tidy up the code that I have (possibly implementing an abstract class for Player and Dealer to inherit from). 

After that, I need to implement either split or double as potential moves for the player.

Beyond that, the card drawing function of Deck could be improved as Random's unsuccessful attempts to choose a card (especially when most of the cards are drawn from the deck) slow down the program ever so slightly.
